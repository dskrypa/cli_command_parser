CLI Command Parser
******************

Command Parser is a class-based CLI argument parser that defines parameters with descriptors.

The primary goals of this project:
  - Make it easy to define subcommands and actions in an clean and organized manner
  - Allow for inheritance so that common parameters don't need to be repeated
  - Make it easy to handle common initialization tasks for all actions / subcommands once
  - Reduce the amount of boilerplate code that is necessary for setting up parsing and handling argument values


This project is still a work in progress.
